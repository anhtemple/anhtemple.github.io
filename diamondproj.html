<h1>After the Fact: Seeing Beyond Fact Checking Trump's Twitter</h1>
<h2>Abstract </h2>
		<p>While there is still much attention paid to the partisanship of news organizations , a big gap exists in our understanding of how journalists handle misinformation and debunk lies for  their readers. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, fake news dominated social media and was perpetuated by false claims made by then-Republican candidate Donald J. Trump on Twitter. National news organizations committed a great deal of time and space to stop the spread of “alternative facts” and inform voters, yet the effectiveness of fact checking during the election was questionable, as we have seen with the rise of Trumpism. <br>
	<br>
		My research looks at the activity on Trump’s Twitter account during the time between his  nomination and his election. Specifically, I will examine factors such as the authenticity of his tweets, and the accuracy of his claims, whereas likes, and retweets will be examined for significance. Based on these data, my research seeks fact checking articles from most-trusted news organizations and unravels how journalists respond to fake news that spreads on Twitter. <br>
<br>
		More specifically, my research explores the following questions: Is fact checking an intuitive reactionary component or a strategic decision put in place to guarantee maximum impact? Is fact checking the shortcut to winning back public trust? The results of this study might provide valuable insight on standard journalistic practice and potentially change how we perceive truth in the news.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>“Where did we go wrong?” must have been the most asked question among journalists in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. National publications like the New York Times, the Washington Post and even smaller local newspaper with the circulation well under 500,000 have dedicated time and labor to fact check. Journalists take fact-checking politicians seriously because democracy goes hand in hand with well-vetted news and informed voters. Journalists in America are protected under the First Amendment because their job is so crucial in electing the most ardent and deserving public servants.
 	<br>
	However, Donald Trump was no politician, and his way of going around the politics of Washington was unprecedentedly ingenious. His Twitter was more powerful than any spokesperson in reaching his support base. For example, in the first presidential debate, the total engagement on Twitter amounted to 17.1 million interactions, making it the most-tweeted debate ever. Trump was mentioned in 6.3 million tweets, while Clinton was mentioned in 2.7 million tweets. In short, Trump’s supporters and opponents were way louder than Clinton’s.
	<br>
	Of the 33 claims in the first presidential debate, most Clinton’s claims ranged from half false to true, whereas most Trump’s claims ranged from half true to false.
