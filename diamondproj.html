<h1>After the Fact: Seeing Beyond Fact Checking Trump's Twitter</h1>
<h2>Abstract </h2>
		<p>While there is still much attention paid to the partisanship of news organizations , a big gap exists in our understanding of how journalists handle misinformation and debunk lies for  their readers. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, fake news dominated social media and was perpetuated by false claims made by then-Republican candidate Donald J. Trump on Twitter. National news organizations committed a great deal of time and space to stop the spread of “alternative facts” and inform voters, yet the effectiveness of fact checking during the election was questionable, as we have seen with the rise of Trumpism. <br>
	<br>
		My research looks at the activity on Trump’s Twitter account during the time between his  nomination and his election. Specifically, I will examine factors such as the authenticity of his tweets, and the accuracy of his claims, whereas likes, and retweets will be examined for significance. Based on these data, my research seeks fact checking articles from most-trusted news organizations and unravels how journalists respond to fake news that spreads on Twitter. <br>
<br>
		More specifically, my research explores the following questions: Is fact checking an intuitive reactionary component or a strategic decision put in place to guarantee maximum impact? Is fact checking the shortcut to winning back public trust? The results of this study might provide valuable insight on standard journalistic practice and potentially change how we perceive truth in the news.
